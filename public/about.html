<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there!I'm curious and creative individual with a passion for learning and exploring new ideas in free time.
Right now i am learning to code and I started with web development course online by udemy which was real fun.
It started to built my intreset in coding.I am persuing BCA and i want to code as much as i can to do MCA further.
</p>

<p>Another thing is what i do in free time? So to be honest i love to watch movies and series and to watch Tv.
  My screen time with Tv and mobile was increasing day by day then i realized it is not worth it and not cool at all, So i thought i should 
  satrt to foucs on studies and i started coding and i am seriously loving it.
</p>

<p>I play badminton sometimes and i love to do makeup and get ready.Sometimes i bake also for my own satisfaction.
  Now i really think that, in this age building up good career is most impotant to become independent at some point of life and even for happiness 
  of our parents.Parents do all efforts to give us best life, They forget thier life to make us happy, So in return we also shhould do something and
   it really take me a long time  to understand this.
